# LearningMIs
 Repository for my course project for my Natural Language Processing Course (CS584) taken Fall 2024

 For best results, run the notebook in Google Colab. You will also need to ensure that the File Structure in your Google Drive matches the structure used in the notebook, or you may modify the notebook to fit your needs. You will also need a GitHub access token to download the data used to train and test the models.

## Introduction
The SIGMORPHON workshop, a long-running intercollegiate computational
linguistics workshop, has been tackling the issues that come with learning morphology,
phonology, and phonetics through machine learning methods. A major
component of the competition is devoted to the learning of Morphological Inflection
across many different target languages with the help of machine learning
techniques. There have been many submissions and approaches to these tasks
over the years, namely Straight-Through Gradient Estimation for Hard Attention, One-Size-Fits-All Multilingual Models, Sparse Two-headed Models
for Inflection, and Universal Morphological Reinflection in 52 Languages.
My goal for this project is to create a generalizable model for learning these
morphological inflections through previous examples. I hoped to achieve similar
if not better results than the papers presented for the task, and evaluate the
modelâ€™s viability for use as a component in multilingual machine translation
models, perhaps reducing confounding factors and ambiguity in translation and
strengthening semantic transferability across languages. As it will become apparent
later, I was largely unsuccessful in my endeavors. However, working on
this task has given me a greater and more nuanced understanding of the problems
associated with learning these inflections and their potential applications
in Machine Translation.
